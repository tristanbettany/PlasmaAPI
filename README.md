# Plasma API

This code serves as a base infrastructure for a PHP API.

It includes an example endpoint in the form of listing users from a database. 
There is no authentication in place right now. There is however a middleware implimentation in place
where that should be done.

To get up and running do the following:

- run ```app.bat build```
- add ```api.test``` to your hosts file
- visit ```api.test``` / ```api.test/users``` in your browser
